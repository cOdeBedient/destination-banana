# Destination: Banana | Group Project
**Overview:**
Destination: Banana is a web game built around the Wikipeida API. The goal of this project was to build an application around an API, complimented by technologies new we taught ourselves to use.

## Testing
We used Cypress to simulate user interactions to identify issues early. Cypress offers an end-to-end testing framework that allows us to test both happy and sad paths, ensuring our application behaves as expected under various conditions. This includes:

- Thorough testing of application views to ensure each page displays correctly.
- Comprehensive testing of user flows to confirm seamless navigation and functionality.
- Making specific assertions about the content within DOM elements to verify accurate rendering of information.
- Properly stubbing network requests to test interactions with external APIs without reliance on live data.
- Stubbing and testing asynchronous functionality to ensure both expected (happy path) and unexpected (sad path) outcomes are handled correctly.

Our testing approach, emphasizing coverage of both existing and new features, aligns with our objectives of mastering React and creating an intuitive user experience with Router.
